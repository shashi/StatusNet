/**
 * Sample plugin main class
 *
 * Each plugin requires a main class to interact with the StatusNet system.
 *
 * The main class usually extends the Plugin class that comes with StatusNet.
 *
 * The class has standard-named methods that will be called when certain events
 * happen in the code base. These methods have names like 'onX' where X is an
 * event name (see EVENTS.txt for the list of available events). Event handlers
 * have pre-defined arguments, based on which event they're handling. A typical
 * event handler:
 *
 *    function onSomeEvent($paramA, &$paramB)
 *    {
 *        if ($paramA == 'jed') {
 *            throw new Exception(sprintf(_m("Invalid parameter %s"), $paramA));
 *        }
 *        $paramB = 'spock';
 *        return true;
 *    }
 *
 * Event handlers must return a boolean value. If they return false, all other
 * event handlers for this event (in other plugins) will be skipped, and in some
 * cases the default processing for that event would be skipped. This is great for
 * replacing the default action of an event.
 *
 * If the handler returns true, processing of other event handlers and the default
 * processing will continue. This is great for extending existing functionality.
 *
 * If the handler throws an exception, processing will stop, and the exception's
 * error will be shown to the user.
 *
 * To install a plugin (like this one), site admins add the following code to
 * their config.php file:
 *
 *     addPlugin('Sample');
 *
 * Plugins must be installed in one of the following directories:
 *
 *     local/plugins/{$pluginclass}.php
 *     local/plugins/{$name}/{$pluginclass}.php
 *     local/{$pluginclass}.php
 *     local/{$name}/{$pluginclass}.php
 *     plugins/{$pluginclass}.php
 *     plugins/{$name}/{$pluginclass}.php
 *
 * Here, {$name} is the name of the plugin, like 'Sample', and {$pluginclass} is
 * the name of the main class, like 'SamplePlugin'. Plugins that are part of the
 * main StatusNet distribution go in 'plugins' and third-party or local ones go
 * in 'local'.
 *
 * Simple plugins can be implemented as a single module. Others are more complex
 * and require additional modules; these should use their own directory, like
 * 'local/plugins/{$name}/'. All files related to the plugin, including images,
 * JavaScript, CSS, external libraries or PHP modules should go in the plugin
 * directory.
