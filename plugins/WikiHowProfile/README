This is an additional plugin which piggybacks on OpenID authentication to pull
profile information from WikiHow user pages when creating or updating accounts.

WikiHow runs a customized MediaWiki setup, with locally-built extensions to add
profile features such as an avatar. As this additional info isn't yet exposed
through OpenID, we need to pull it separately.
