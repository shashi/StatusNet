[OpenMicroBlogging](http://openmicroblogging.org/) is a protocol that
lets users of one [microblogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microblogging) service
subscribe to notices by users of another service. The protocol, based on
[OAuth](http://oauth.net/), is open and free, and doesn't depend on any
central authority to maintain the federated microblogs.

The [StatusNet](http://status.net/) software that runs %%site.name%% supports
OpenMicroBlogging 0.1. Anyone can make a new installation of StatusNet on their
own servers, and users of that new installation can subscribe to notices from
%%site.name%%.

Remote subscription
-------------------

If you have an account on a remote site that supports OpenMicroBlogging, and you
want to subscribe to the notices of a user on this site, click on the "Subscribe"
link under their avatar on their profile page. This should take you to the
[remote subscription](%%action.remotesubscribe%%) page. Make sure that you've got the
right nickname registered, and enter your profile URL on the other microblogging
service.

You'll be taken to your microblogging service, where you'll be asked to confirm the
subscription. When you confirm, your service will receive new notifications from
the user on %%site.name%%, and your service will forward them to you (using IM, SMS,
the Web, or whatever else).
