Users on %%site.name%% can create *groups* that other users can join.
Groups can be a great way to share information and entertainment with
a group of people who have a common interest or background.

You can find out about groups on the server on the
[Groups](%%action.groups%%) page. You can join a group by clicking on
the "Join" button either in the group list or on the group's home page.

Starting a new group
--------------------

If you want, you can start a new group for friends and people with
common interests. Note that all groups are free for anyone to join.

To start a new group, use the [new group](%%action.newgroup%%) tool
and fill out the form. Describe your group as best you can if you want
people to be able to find it.

When choosing the nickname for your group, try to keep it short. The
nickname is included in every message to and from the group, so the
less chars the better. Try using acronyms for organizations, or
airport codes for places (like 'pdx' instead of 'portland').

Sending messages to a group
---------------------------

You can send a message to a group using the syntax "!groupname"
anywhere in the message. If you have more than one group named, the
notice will go to each group. Only members can send notices to a
group, and groups do not respond to direct messages (DMs).

Receiving messages
------------------

New group messages will appear in your inbox, and will also come to
your phone or IM client if you've set them up to receive notices.

Remote groups
-------------

While it's technically possible, this version of StatusNet does not
support remote group membership.
